# Prototype / Spike Idea

##### Comment Box using MERN
I would like to build a simple comment function where user can put his/her name and comment. The comments will be saved on a database. Users might also be able to update or delete comments. 

1.	React UI
2.	NoSQL database with MongoDB
3.	Express.js and Node.js for server
4.	Achieve Create and Read first then Update and Delete
