### Retrospectives
+ **Executive summary:** This week, I have figure out the problem, which is each disease has a different databases and we want to filter some of the data in just one call.
+ What went well: I used mLab to manage all WHO disease databases in different collections and retrieve the data that I need in just one call.
+ What did not go well: Automation: If we add more databases to mLab, I need to edit the query to update the call.
+ What was interesting: I learnt so much more: JS async process, MongoDB query and import/export JSON files to mLab through command line.

### Plan for next week
+ Integrate front-end with back-end
+ Integrate with other pages
