# Prototype / Spike Idea

##### Comment Box using MERN
I would like to build a simple comment function where user can put his/her name and comment. The comments will be saved on a database. Users might also be able to update or delete comments. 

1.	React UI
2.	NoSQL database with MongoDB
3.	Express.js and Node.js for server
4.	Achieve Create and Read first then Update and Delete

The prototype is built based on the tutorial on (Medium by Bryan Gilbraith)[https://medium.com/@bryantheastronaut/ok-here-we-go-b9f683c5a00c]

##### User stories
+ As a commenter, I want post a comment, so that I can express my thought.
+ As a reader, I want to see all previous comments, so that I know what others think.
+ As a user, I want to edit my old comments, so that I can fix my errors.
+ As a user, I want to delete my comments, so that I can write a new one.
