# Final Check-in and Retrospective

+ **Executive summary:** We have finished our project using full stack MERN. The url of the site is [here](healthgram.ca).

+ What went well: I have learned and applied full stack dev in 13 weeks. It is an interesting learning process and I feel more comfortable working with back-end.

+ What did not go well: Some functions of the website is not completed as planned. The team is failed to integrate authentication module with planner module. They work well seperately but in order to develop more functionalities, we need to figure out how to integrate them.  

+ What was interesting: I have more experiences working as a PM and a full-stack dev. I feel more comfortable developing complex program. 

+ What would be done differently next time: Start earlier and more proper planning. We spend too much time researching databases but no one tries to test how the app should work. Thus, we are a bit behind the schedule.
